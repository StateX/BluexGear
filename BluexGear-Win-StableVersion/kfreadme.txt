=====================
The hack does the following: gives you a high resolution select screen.
Thus you have a ton more room to work with all around, which is handy if you
have a lot of characters. Included in the bundle is the system.def by the
guy that did the original hacking of the EXE.

Additionally, you can now use both high-res and lo-res stages with this version
of winmugen

UPDATE: Apparently there's a 

Usage
=====
Just drop into your mugen folder with lo res stages.

System.def is for use if you use either mugen's default screenpack or 'big'
screenpack that come with vanilla mugen. It just gives you a lot more space
from the getgo with little hassle.

To use high res stages: if they don't work by default (thus appearing huge) or
you're making your own, add this line to the def file for the stage under [StageInfo]:

HIres = 1

With that, winmugen shall detect it as a high-res stage.

F.A.Q.
======
Q: Can I host this?
A: I'd rather keep it in one spot to be honest as I plan to modify it further.

Q: Isn't hacking wrong?
A: Maybe...and I'm not going to beat about the bush. But at the same time I don't
   believe elecbyte is truly back...and I'd rather give something meaningful for
   prosperity.

Q: WAH! My select screen looks fucked up!
A: Modify your system.def and your images in your system.sff file as needed. You'll
   have to do some manual work for some screenpacks.

Q: This is just the EXE?
A: You'll need the rest of winmugen to fully run this. I'm not giving you the whole 
   shabang. Check the links on RS's menu for the winmugen download? You'll need the
   original.

Q: Is this locked into DR4 still?
A: Should be. Kinda self-defeating if it isn't.

Q: I have a blank winmugen. Where does system.def go?
A: In the data folder.
